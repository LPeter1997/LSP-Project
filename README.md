# LSP-Project
A Language Server implementation for a university project.

# Why?
This semester one of my courses requires every one of us to independently research a chosen field. Since language design is my passion, I chose that. I'm already developing a compiler, so I thought this would be a good opportunity to create tooling for my language. So I settled on developing an LSP framework and come out with a somewhat usable toy language server fot a stripped version of my language.

# Goals
The goal is simply to develop something that assists you if you ever plan to use my language. A secondlary goal is to keep a clean codebase and try to keep modern C++ practices. Finally, I'd like to create documentation and an example for anyone attempting the same.
